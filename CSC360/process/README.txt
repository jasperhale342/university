Must first run the make file to compile each file. To do this run make

To run PMan type ./PMan

There are two processes that you can run: foo and bar

foo does not terminate unless the user kills it

bar does terminate after 5 seconds, which proves that a zombie process can be handled 

when running commands after executing PMan, it must be like: bg ./foo
